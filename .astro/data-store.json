We moved out to a 3 acre property about 25 minutes outside of Portland, so our proximity to (good quality) coffee shops has been a factor.

Isn't this post about a home espresso machine? I'm glad you asked.\n\nWhen it comes to brewing espresso at home, having a good grinder is perhaps the most important element in your setup. If you grind your coffee too coarse, your shots pour much too quickly and are under extracted, resulting in coffee that's weak and sour. On the other hand, if you grind your coffee too fine, your shots will pour too slowly and are over extracted, resulting in coffee that's bitter and harsh.\n\nThe best way to ensure your grind is the right size is to invest in a proper espresso grinder. There are many fantastic machines out there these days, and we debated between a few machines: The Turin DF64S, the Timemore Sculptor 064S, and the Niche Zero. Each are burr grinders that feature low retention, which is quite important when you're making espresso. Let's briefly talk about each and which one we decided on...\n\n### Turin DF64S\n\n![Turin DF64S](/images/blog/turin-blog.png)\n\nThe Turin was the cheapest option of the grinders, and for the price seems to be a quality grinder that provides excellent consistency for pulling espresso shots. It's a newer company to the grinder world, and offer a direct to consumer model that allows better prices than competitors. The industrial design is understated, and it's not too large. However, this grinder is incredibly loud during operation, and this proved to be a real deal breaker for us. On to the next option!\n\n### Timemore Sculptor 064S\n\n![Timemore Sculptor 064S](/images/blog/timemore-blog.png)\n\nThe Timemore is a lovely grinder, full stop. There's a lot of neat features here: the sculptor series uses their own, patented burrs, offers an adjustable grinder RPM selector, as well as a rotary knocker to remove any additional grounds that may be left inside the grinder due to static cling. It has a magnetic lid to cover the beans during grinding, and a magnetic base that holds the grounds container beneath the funnel. After reading reviews, it sounded like this grinder was a bit \"fussier\" to operate and wasn't as straightforward as we'd like. This leads us to the Niche.\n\n### Niche Zero\n\n![Niche Zero](/images/blog/niche-blog.png)\nThe Niche Zero was originally started as an Indiegogo campaign in 2017. It quickly surpassed their funding goals, and has been a staple in quality grinder lists ever since. It's specifically designed for low retention (the \"zero\" in the name speaks to their claims of zero retention), ease of use, and convenience. It's designed so well that it makes for a painless and enjoyable process. The grounds container is designed to fit neatly inside a 58mm portafilter, so you can quickly dump the ground coffee into it with little to no spillage.\n\nIt's the most expensive grinder out of the options we were considering, and there's no shortage of debate online as to whether or not it's \"worth the money\". But for us, the Niche really stood out. Its quiet operation, paired with the ease of use really won the day. We decided to purchase this grinder, and we're glad we did!\n\n## The Machine\n\nThese days, there are so many great options when it comes to home espresso machines. It seems as if the last decade has ushered in a new era of high quality options that would have cost twice as much 10-15 years ago. After investing in the right grinder, we wanted to choose an espresso machine that wasn't prohibitively expensive, made good coffee, and was made with high enough quality parts that would make it decently repairable.\n\nI could go through all the different options we looked at, but with the machine I'll skip right to the chase: we chose the Profitec Go and purchased it from Clive Coffee here in Portland. It's a single boiler machine, which means that it uses one boiler to heat water for both pulling shots as well as steaming milk. That's a trade off; you can't pull a shot and immediately steam milk, given that the boiler needs to adjust to the higher temperature required for steam.\n\n![Profitec Go](/images/blog/profitec-blog.png)\n\nBut as we looked at the options available to us, the Profitec stood out. It's made of high quality parts from a reputable company, it's relatively affordable (compared to many higher end machines), and reviews said it consistently produces high quality shots of espresso due to its temperature control and ease of use. We were sold! \n\n## In Practice\n\nIt's been several months since we made the leap into home espresso, with its steep learning curve and quirks. Was it worth it? After months of daily espresso drinks, from flat whites to iced americanos, I find myself answering that question with a wholehearted: Yes, it's absolutely worth it. Here are a few things I've learned that have made all the difference for me, as well as made this entire process super enjoyable:\n\n### Slightly longer shot: My sweet spot\n\nI've found that I really enjoy a slightly longer shot pull with a bit more water volume. It's not quite a Lungo, but somewhere in between an espresso and Lungo. It's a bit more balanced of a flavor and I find that it has really hit the spot in a hot beverage. \n\n### Consistency is key\n\nWe've kept our espresso beans the same this entire time, along with the grams in/out while pulling shots, with the same espresso basket. Brewing espresso involves a lot of different variables, so I've found that honing in on the right bean and overall approach has made my shots much more consistent and enjoyable. The biggest factor is honestly the beans: Changing your beans so that the bean, the roast, as well as the freshness are all new will lead to a lot more fiddling with your grinder to ensure your shots are pulling consistently!\n\n### Know your machine\n\nOur Profitec is a single boiler machine, which means it only has one element to heat both the steam wand as well as pulling shots. These tasks require different water temperatures, so it can lead to needing to wait in between pulling a shot and being able to steam your milk. As I've gotten to know the machine, I've recognized that it's much faster for the machine to go down in temperature from steam -> shot pulling, so I find that steaming my milk first is a better way to prep for a cortado or flat white. It's a nice little hack, and one that I've only found out from using the machine daily. \n\n## Final thoughts\n\nI'm a beverage guy, through and through. I love having a beautiful little machine on my kitchen counter, I love the ritual of weighing my beans, I love the satisfaction of a perfectly pulled shot... it all works for me! Getting into home espresso has been a journey filled with lots of trial and error, but it's been incredibly rewarding. And at the end of the day, I'm able to make some delicious beverages that bring me some joy, and make each day just a little better.

From innovative indie releases to groundbreaking electronic albums, the musical landscape continues to evolve in exciting ways.\n\n## Top Albums\n\n### 1. Hovvdy - Hovvdy\n\n![Hovvdy artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/Hovvdy.jpg)\n   - Released: April 26, 2024\n   - Standout track: Bubba\n\nI’ve been a long time fan of Hovvdy ever since their album Cranberry, and every release since has captivated me. Charlie and Will have always traded songwriting duties, yet their albums consistently feel cohesive. Their melodies are subtle but quite moving, and their lyrical approach to storytelling pulls you in and paints a vibrant picture. Hovvdy’s songs span the gamut from fun to contemplative to a downright gut punch. I also love recording and producing my own music, so when I found out that the band employed a new production technique for this new record, I was intrigued. They called it “Operation Magma”: they recorded the new album using only iPhones and a Zoom recorder to enable them to record whenever inspiration struck. \n\n### 2. When I'm Called - Jake Xerxes Fussell\n![JXF artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/jxf.jpg)\n   - Released: July 12, 2024\n   - Standout track: Leaving Here, Don’t Know Where I’m Going\n\nJake is a folklorist, whose parents also had a penchant for history and uncovering songs and writings from America’s past. I don’t quite understand what percentage of Jake’s songs are actually 100% his vs. lyrics he’s found from some dusty corner of an antique store book, but his albums always capture my heart and soul. He’s a phenomenal guitar player, and more often than not his finger picked guitar lines are what will get stuck in my head long after I’ve listened. This newest album is perfect for a summer day’s drive through the country, when you’re daydreaming about what’s around the next corner and happy to be alive. \n\n### 3. Three - Four Tet\n![Four Tet artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/fourtet.jpg)\n   - Released: March 15, 2024\n   - Standout track: Storm Crystals\n\nI haven’t historically connected with Four Tet’s albums, due largely to the fact that I’m not the biggest fan of dance music. He’s mostly worked in the realm of EDM/four on the floor work for his last several albums and the results didn’t stick with me for much longer than one or two listens. Three is an exception: there’s something so dynamic and engrossing about the songs that Kieran has put together that it ended up playing on repeat for me earlier in the year. It also helped that he graciously agreed to be a guest on Tape Notes, one of my absolute favorite podcasts, to speak about how the album came together. It has some dancey bits, but overall feels like a more meditative electronic album.\n\n### 4. I Wish You Way More Than Luck - Lo Moon \n![Lo Moon artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/lomoon.jpg)\n   - Released: April 5, 2024\n   - Standout track: Waiting a Lifetime\n\nThis album was so much fun, and it came out right when I was in the mood for a bigger, bombastic rock record. I didn’t know about Lo Moon, but discovered them when Dave Hartley (bassist for the War on Drugs) shared via social media that he had tracked some bass parts with them for this album. I felt I should give it a shot, so I followed the link he shared and was immediately hooked. The production is really beautiful and the end result is a moody, atmospheric rock album that is best listened to at full volume.\n\n### 5. Superkilen - Svaneborg Kardyb \n![Superkilen artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/superkilen.jpg)\n   - Released: October 18, 2024\n   - Standout track: St. Pancras\n\nI discovered the Danish duo Svaneborg Kardyb when they performed a tiny desk concert several years ago, and was immediately drawn into their blend of live percussion and swirling synthesizers. This album came out at the perfect time in 2024 to usher in the fall and become fully engrained in my listening habits by the winter. It's cozy melodies and tones made a fantastic companion to the dark and wet Pacific Northwest winter. \n\n### 6. A Million Easy Payments - Little Kid \n![Little kid artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/littlekid.jpg)\n   - Released: February 23, 2024\n   - Standout track: Bad Energy\n\nThis record captured my attention immediately, from the lovely cover painting by James Lee Chiahan to the slow burn songwriting of Kenny Boothby. The album is full of delicate instrumentation that serve as crucial pieces of slow building songs. It's not an album that the impatient will resonate with; Boothby likes to embrace repetition while taking his time. The vocal delivery paired with some truly phenomenal lyrics made a big impact on me, and I purchased a copy on vinyl after only a few listens through. \n\n### 7. Talker - Wilderado\n![Wilderado artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/talker.jpg)\n   - Released: September 20, 2024\n   - Standout track: Talker\n\nI'd never heard of Wilderado until a post by James McAlister caught my eye: James is a talented drummer who's also newer to the producing space who partnered with Wilderado to produce this treat. I'm not one for partaking, but Talker is the musical equivalent of a spliff and a light beer on a perfect summer day. It's just got an easy, breezy ethos that permeates through every square inch of the record, and it was a blast to turn on and chill to. \n\n### 8. Horrible Occurrences - Advance Base\n![Advance Base artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/advancebase.jpg)\n   - Released: December 6, 2024\n   - Standout track: The Tooth Fairy\n\nOwen snuck this record in under the wire in December, and it immediately found a place in my top ten. The album is full of wonderful (yet horrible) stories of characters and their love, loss, and pain shared with a backdrop of electric piano and drum machines. The music itself is straightforward and somewhat elementary, but I was drawn in by his storytelling and emotional delivery of these made up characters and their little fragmented worlds.  \n\n### 9. Bellow - Witch Bolt\n![Witch Bolt artwork](/images/blog/albums-2024/witchbolt.jpg)\n   - Released: July 21, 2024\n   - Standout track: Lifting Light from the Ground\n\nDungeon Synth is cool.   \n\n## Honorable Mentions\n\n- [Other notable albums...]\n\n\n## Looking Forward\n\n[Discuss upcoming releases you're excited about...]","src/content/blog/favorite-albums-2024.md","74e59f93350ee212",{"html":112,"metadata":113},"\u003Cp>2024 has been an incredible year for music so far. From innovative indie releases to groundbreaking electronic albums, the musical landscape continues to evolve in exciting ways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"top-albums\">Top Albums\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-hovvdy---hovvdy\">1.

Charlie and Will have always traded songwriting duties, yet their albums consistently feel cohesive. Their melodies are subtle but quite moving, and their lyrical approach to storytelling pulls you in and paints a vibrant picture. Hovvdy’s songs span the gamut from fun to contemplative to a downright gut punch. I also love recording and producing my own music, so when I found out that the band employed a new production technique for this new record, I was intrigued. They called it “Operation Magma”: they recorded the new album using only iPhones and a Zoom recorder to enable them to record whenever inspiration struck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"2-when-im-called---jake-xerxes-fussell\">2.

I don’t quite understand what percentage of Jake’s songs are actually 100% his vs. lyrics he’s found from some dusty corner of an antique store book, but his albums always capture my heart and soul. He’s a phenomenal guitar player, and more often than not his finger picked guitar lines are what will get stuck in my head long after I’ve listened. This newest album is perfect for a summer day’s drive through the country, when you’re daydreaming about what’s around the next corner and happy to be alive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"3-three---four-tet\">3.

He’s mostly worked in the realm of EDM/four on the floor work for his last several albums and the results didn’t stick with me for much longer than one or two listens. Three is an exception: there’s something so dynamic and engrossing about the songs that Kieran has put together that it ended up playing on repeat for me earlier in the year. It also helped that he graciously agreed to be a guest on Tape Notes, one of my absolute favorite podcasts, to speak about how the album came together. It has some dancey bits, but overall feels like a more meditative electronic album.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"4-i-wish-you-way-more-than-luck---lo-moon\">4.

I didn’t know about Lo Moon, but discovered them when Dave Hartley (bassist for the War on Drugs) shared via social media that he had tracked some bass parts with them for this album. I felt I should give it a shot, so I followed the link he shared and was immediately hooked. The production is really beautiful and the end result is a moody, atmospheric rock album that is best listened to at full volume.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"5-superkilen---svaneborg-kardyb\">5.
