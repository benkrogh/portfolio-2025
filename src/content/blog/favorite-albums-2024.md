   - Released:
   - Standout tracks: Bubba

I’ve been a long time fan of Hovvdy ever since their album Cranberry, and every release since has captivated me. Charlie and Will have always traded songwriting duties, yet their albums consistently feel cohesive. Their melodies are subtle but quite moving, and their lyrical approach to storytelling pulls you in and paints a vibrant picture. Hovvdy’s songs span the gamut from fun to contemplative to a downright gut punch. I also love recording and producing my own music, so when I found out that the band employed a new production technique for this new record, I was intrigued. They called it “Operation Magma”: they recorded the new album using only iPhones and a Zoom recorder to enable them to record whenever inspiration struck.
