      Bodega and convenience store owners don’t have access to modern tools.
While consumers enjoy streamlined ecommerce experiences and easy to use apps, most bodega owners in New York City spend much of their time acquiring their inventory at large, cash-only warehouses. 
      <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
        Our goal was to create a platform that preserves cultural heritage while providing artisans with tools for success in the digital age.

        Bazaar has to be approachable and easy to use for business owners who aren’t tech savvy. 
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          We created an onboarding system that was easy for business owners to complete, with a setup wizard that continued to guide them through finalizing details for their business.
        </CaseStudyText.Secondary>
     <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
        We knew that time and efficiency was important, so many of the setup questions were all about saving the business owner time. We also ensured they knew how to use the main functionality with a brief breakdown of the interface.

        Search: Way easier than walking the aisles of a wholesale warehouse. 
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          When it came to finding products the business owners needed, we knew it had to be quick and easy. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we modeled Bazaar’s search after standard eCommerce patterns. The result was a search that business owner’s didn’t have to learn how to use, and allowed them to find what they needed quickly.

        Once business owners found the products they wanted, adding them to their cart worked as expected.
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          When they viewed their cart and checked out, a few features were added that catered to small business owners. The cart itself broke out which businesses their products were shipping from, and shoppers were able to link their bank accounts to pay for their orders.
