        As a Design Director at Square, I scaled and led the design teams focused on foundational tools for our sellers: Catalog, Inventory, and Fulfillment workflows. 
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          As part of the core leadership for an organization of nearly 200 people, I worked with product and engineering to prioritize roadmaps, 
        review team health, and cast vision for where we were headed. I also scaled the team from 2 to 8 designers and 
          established process for our team to increase craft and quality.

        Over the course of 3 years, I led several large initiatives from migrations to design system updates.

          This page highlights just a few of the artifacts from various projects, but each one has itâ€™s own story connected that I would be happy to walk through on a call.
