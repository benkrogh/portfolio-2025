      The concept for Square Charge came out of a design workshop: What if we had a faster way for our sellers to process payments on desktop?
      <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
        I teamed up with some of our developers during a hack week to see if we could make it work using only public facing APIs... and we built a functioning app.

      We focused on creating a minimal interface that would allow sellers to quickly enter payment amounts and process transactions with as few clicks as possible.
