        The concept for Square Charge came out of a design workshop: What if we had a faster way for our sellers to process payments on desktop?
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          I worked with my team to create a set of designs that cast a vision for a desktop product that had a companion menu bar app.

      <CaseStudyText client:load>
        We had some compelling concepts, but there were still a lot of questions around how feasible it would be to build.
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          I teamed up with some of our developers during a hack week to see if we could make it work using only public facing APIs... and we built a functioning app.

        Our team won the hack week, and it was time to start working on getting this ready for prime time. We knew there was a customer need based on data and CS requests, but we also created some goals:

          text="Support a keyboard based workflow for ultra fast payments."
        />
      </div>

      <CaseStudyText client:load>
        We focused on creating a minimal interface that would allow sellers to quickly enter payment amounts and process transactions with as few clicks as possible.

        As we got closer to launch, we needed to create a set of marketing materials to help get the word out about the new app.
        <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
          I worked with our creative team to provide creative direction for the app's marketing materials and public website, as well as motion design and video work for help articles.

      />

      <CaseStudyText client:load>
        We released the app after receiving a 6.87 CSAT score in beta. Sellers really loved Square Charge!
