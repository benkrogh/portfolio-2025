      The concept for Square Charge came out of a design workshop: What if we had a faster way for our sellers to process payments on desktop?
      <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
        I worked with my team to create a set of designs that cast a vision for a desktop product that had a companion menu bar app.

    <CaseStudyText client:load>
      We had some compelling concepts, but there were still a lot of questions around how feasible it would be to build.
      <CaseStudyText.Secondary>
        I teamed up with some of our developers during a hack week to see if we could make it work using only public facing APIs... and we built a functioning app.

      Our team won the hack week, and it was time to start working on getting this ready for prime time. We knew there was a customer need based on data and CS requests, but we also created some goals:

      We focused on creating a minimal interface that would allow sellers to quickly enter payment amounts and process transactions with as few clicks as possible.
